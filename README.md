This is a python homework. With tkinter GUI, json and SQLite export and YAML file handling

I made a simple GUI with tkinter. The app basically imports a yaml file with a necessary settings which include the export path,
the database table name, and the object and GUI structure. The application dinamically renders the input and label elements on the screen based on the yaml file.
Then the user can give the inputs, and with the save button they can save it to the memory. 
And when clicked on exit they get exported into a JSON file and a Database aswell.

You can start the app in the command line with:
  python main.py
  
You need to be in the Scripts directory!
